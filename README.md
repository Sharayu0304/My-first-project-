PROJECT TITLE
Online Shopping Cart Simulation<br>
<br>
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
This Python command line project allows the user to browse, add,update, delete the items in this shopping cart. They are also provided with discounts at the checkout. The checkout page estimates and provides the total bill after applying the discount code.
This project contains basic CRUD operatiosn (Create, Read, Upadate and Delete).


THE SHOPPING CART HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:
1. ATALOG VIEWING OF PRODUCTS : The page shows a list of products available for purchase that the user can buy. Each product is provided with an ID number, name and price. This helps the user to easily add/delete/update items in their cart. 

2. ADDING PRODUCTS TO CART : With the help of ID Number, name and price mentioned along with the produc, the user can easily add the specific item to the cart.

3. UPDATING CART(Specification of quantity of particular product):
User can specify or modify the number of products he/she wished to add in the cart. This allows a flexible purchase.

4. DELETING CART ITEMS: User can remove umwanted products from the cart using Product ID Number and name. 

5. VIEWING CART ITEMS: It displays all the products that you have selected for purchase. It also shows the product's ID number, quantiity and subtotal per item. 

6. DISCOUNT CODES : The shopping simulation allows the users to apply discount codes or coupons at the checkout with predefined discounts included such as - 'FLASH65' and 'STUDENT5'. This means it will provide a discount rate of 65 and 5 percent respectively. It will not allow any other codes other that the predefined codes to get applied.

7. CLEARING CART : Users can remove all the items from the cart, thus making it empty. 

8. CHECKOUT PROCESS : The shopping cart simulation will calculatie the final price the user has to pay. It also considers the discount codes. 

9. INVALID ERROR VALIDATION : If the user enters invalid data (invalid product id, discount codes), the system handles those incorrect inputs smoothly. In such cases, it provides appropriate feedback messages bringing the user into notice that they have provided an invalid input. 

10. USER FREINDLY COMMAND-LINE PAGE : The shopping can be done usning a simple text page where you can choose options by typing the appropriate input.


FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO VIEW THE PROJECT (INSTALLATION):
