OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
This Python command line project allows the user to browse, add,update, delete the items in this shopping cart. They are also provided with discounts at the checkout. The checkout page estimates and provides the total bill after applying the discount code.
This project contains basic CRUD operatiosn (Create, Read, Upadate and Delete).


THE SHOPPING CART HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:
1. CATALOG VIEWING OF PRODUCTS : The page shows a list of products available for purchase that the user can buy. Each product is provided with an ID number, name and price.
